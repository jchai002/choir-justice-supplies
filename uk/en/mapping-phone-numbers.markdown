The basic Ooma Office for WeWork package comes with one phone number that is assigned to the Virtual Receptionist by default, and a second phone number that is assigned to the first user. Each user and most extension types (except for ring groups) come bundled with their own phone number that is automatically assigned to that extension when it is created. 

Having multiple phone numbers allows your customers to bypass the virtual receptionist and reach out directly to the employee or extension that they wish to contact. You can also purchase additional phone numbers if you need to map multiple phone numbers from different area codes to one or more extensions.

You can update the default destination for all phone numbers with phone number mapping.

## How do I map a phone number?

You can map a phone by following these instructions:

1. Log into your Ooma Office Manager at [{{ site.office_link.uk }}]({{ site.office_link.uk }}/) and navigate to "[Phone Numbers]({{ site.office_link.uk }}/#manage_phone_number)" under the "Manage" tab.
2. Scroll down to the "Phone Number Mapping" screen, where you will see a list of available phone numbers on your account: \\
   ![available numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ooma_office_wework/manage_phone_numbers_wework.png)

   You can direct each phone number to directly dial a different extension. By default your account will have one phone number that maps to the virtual receptionist.
3. Choose the phone number's new destination from the drop-down menu.
4. Save your changes.

## How can I purchase additional phone numbers?

You can purchase additional phone numbers by following the instructions in our [adding phone numbers FAQ](/uk/en/adding-additional-phone-numbers).

## Can I map a phone number to ring multiple extensions?

You can map a single phone number to ring multiple extensions by setting up a ring group containing all of the numbers that you would like to have ring. You can learn more by visiting our [ring groups FAQ](/uk/en/ring-groups).

## Can I map multiple phone numbers to one extension?

You can map multiple phone numbers to ring any extension such as the virtual receptionist, a ring group, a user's extension, or a conference bridge.
