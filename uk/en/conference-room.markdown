A conference room allows many parties to use their own phones to dial in and start talking as a group. You can use this feature to schedule and conduct meetings even when your team members, customers, and business partners are spread out in remote locations. Using a conference room to bring many people together for a conference call is fast and easy.

## Dialling in to a conference room

All you need to get started is the extension number and PIN for the conference room that has been set up by your Network Administrator.

### Connecting from an internal Ooma Office extension

To connect to a conference room from an internal Ooma Office extension, pick up your phone and dial the extension that is assigned to the room. When you are prompted, enter the conference ID and the optional PIN provided by your Network Administrator to connect to the group call.

### Connecting from outside the Ooma Office system

You can connect to a conference room by dialling the Virtual Receptionist and then entering the extension that has been assigned to the bridge. When you are prompted, enter the conference ID and the optional PIN provided by your Network Administrator to connect to the group call.

If your System Administrator has assigned a direct phone number to the conference room, you may dial it from outside to connect to the conference room and bypass the Virtual Receptionist. Connecting via a direct line is the most convenient option for your customers.

## How will I know when another caller has connected to the conference room?

Whenever a new caller enters the conference room, a beep will sound for all participants to let them know there's a new arrival.
