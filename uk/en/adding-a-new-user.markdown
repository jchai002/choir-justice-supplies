## How can I create a new user?

You can set up a new user by following these instructions:

This can be a mobile phone or a landline number that will receive forwarded calls from the Ooma Office extension.

## How can I update a user’s voicemail preferencesEach extension will have its own voicemail settings that can be configured to the user's preference. You can set up these preferences by following these instructions:

## How can I update a user’s call forwarding settings?

Each user will have their own call forwarding settings that can be configured to their preference. You can set up call forwarding by following these instructions:

1. Log in to your Ooma Office Manager at [{{ site.office_link.uk }}]({{ site.office_link.uk }}) and navigate to "[Extensions]({{ site.office_link.uk }}/#extensions)" under the "Setup" tab.
2. Click on the Settings button in the row of the extension that you wish to modify.
3. Click on the Call forward tab and set up your preferences: \\
   ![call forward tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ooma_office_wework/call_forward_tab_wework.png)
   You can update the following settings:

   * **Enable Call Forwarding:** Toggles call forwarding on and off.
   * **Forwarding number:** The external phone number that all calls will be forwarded to.
   * **Simultaneously ring local extension:** When call forwarding is toggled on, local phones will still ring.
   * **Require key press on answer:** When a call rolls to an external number, you must press 1 to answer it when picking up the phone. Turning this setting on ensures that calls will only roll to the user's Ooma Office voicemail if the forwarded call is not answered.
4. Save your changes.

Keep in mind that when call forwarding is enabled it will override all of your other extension settings. To revert to your original settings, turn call forwarding off.
