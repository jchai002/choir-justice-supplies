The Ooma Office for WeWork system has several different calling options to choose from. The article below outlines each of the different types of calls you can make and receive as part of your basic Ooma Office subscription, and explains how to perform each option.

## Receiving incoming calls

An extension will ring when the number assigned to it has been dialled directly, or when the Virtual Receptionist redirects an incoming call to that extension. You can answer a call by picking up the IP phone when it rings.

## Dialling internal numbers

You can call another extension by dialling the extension number (2XXX). Calling a virtual extension places a call to the external forwarding number.

## Dialling out

You can make an external call by picking up your phone and dialling the outbound number as you normally would:

* 0X XX XX XX XX for domestic calls
* 112 or 999 for emergency services
* 00 XX ... XX for international calls

You do not need to dial "0" or any other special code to make an external phone call.

Calls to landlines and mobile phones in the UK are included in your regular plan. 

In addition to the calling options listed above, your Account Administrator can activate a Prepaid Account that all end-user employees can use to make calls to international numbers and to directory services.

## Calling international numbers

If there are sufficient funds in your Prepaid Account, you can take advantage of the low international calling rates that Ooma offers by dialling 00, followed by the country code and phone number.

You will hear the Prepaid Account balance before your call is connected, letting you know that sufficient funds are available to complete your call.
