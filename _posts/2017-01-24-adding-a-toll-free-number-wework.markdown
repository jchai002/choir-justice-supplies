Adding a toll-free number to your business just makes sense. A toll-free number conveys a professional, big-business persona that can add authenticity to your small business's brand. It can also give your business a national presence in the US or Canada since it allows customers from these countries to contact your business free of charge.

## How do I set up a toll-free number?

You can set up a toll-free number by following these instructions:

3. Click Confirm to add the toll-free number to your Ooma Office account.

   **Note:** You cannot set up Ooma Office with a toll-free number as your primary number. The main number on your Ooma Office account must be a local number.

## How many toll-free numbers can I have on my Ooma Office account?

You can have multiple toll-free numbers on your Ooma Office account. If you would like more than one toll-free number, please contact Customer Support.

## How can I assign a toll-free number to an extension?

Once you have set up your toll-free number, you can assign it to any desired extension by visiting the "[Numbers](https://office.ooma.com/phone_numbers)" page under the "Setup" tab.

## How much does a toll-free number cost?

The first toll-free number that you add to your account is free. Additional toll-free numbers cost $9.95/month for US customers, or CAD $14.95/month for Canadian customers.

Your toll-free number includes 500 minutes of free inbound calling per month. If you exceed 500 minutes per month, then your account will be charged at 3.4¢ per additional minute.

	## Is there a calling plan I can subscribe to if I expect to receive a lot of toll-free calls?

	If you are receiving more than 500 minutes per month of incoming toll-free calls, you can subscribe to a calling plan to reduce the cost to your business. There are two plans currently available:

	* 1,000 additional minutes of toll-free number calling per month (1,500 minutes total) for $15 per month. Additional minutes are charged at 2.9¢ per minute.
	* 2,500 additional minutes of toll-free number calling per month (3,000 minutes total) for $30 per month. Additional minutes are charged at 2.4¢ per minute.

	If you would like to subscribe to one of these plans, you can do so by visiting the Add-Ons section of Ooma Office Manager and clicking on [Services](https://office.ooma.com/accessories/toll_free_plan).
