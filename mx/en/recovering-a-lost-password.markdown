If you have lost or forgotten your Ooma Office for WeWork password, it can be recovered by the Account Administrator by following these steps:

1. Visit the Ooma Office Manager at [{{ site.office_link.mx }}]({{ site.office_link.mx }}/), select the appropriate flag for your country from the dropdown, and then click the "password reset" link at the bottom: \\
   ![reset password]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ooma_office_wework/login_screen_reset_password.png)

2. Enter the Ooma Office phone number and the email address that is on file for the account administrator.
3. A new password will be emailed to that address shortly.
4. When access to the account is regained, don't forget to follow the "[Changing your account password](/mx/en/changing-your-account-password)" instructions to update your Ooma Office password!
