## Accessing your voicemail

If you have an extension mapped to your phone, then you have access to a Voicemail box that you can check and update as necessary. There are many ways to access your Voicemail, no matter where you are. To get started, decide which option below you would like to use and then follow the instructions.

### From your Ooma Office IP phone

If you would like to check your voicemail, just pick up the phone press the messages button or dial your own extension number.

**Note:** The first time you access your voicemail, you will be prompted to select a new PIN during the initial setup process for your voicemail box.

### From another Ooma Office phone or from an outside phone line

If you would like to check your voicemail from another Ooma Office phone or from an outside phone line, wait until the call rolls to voicemail and then press [*] and enter your PIN. If this is the first time you access your voicemail, you will need your PIN. If you do not have this number, contact your System Administrator to have them set a new PIN so that you can log in the first time.

### Dialing through the virtual receptionist

If you are out of the office and do not have a direct phone number to reach your extension, you can dial in to your Voicemail through the virtual receptionist. Simply call the Ooma Office number that is answered by the Virtual Receptionist and press [*] when the call connects. Next, dial your extension number and then enter your PIN.

**Note:** This feature may have been disabled by your Ooma Office for WeWork Account Administrator if there is no voice prompt after you press [*].

### Listening via email

Your new voice messages will be automatically forwarded to your email so that you can listen from anywhere. The audio message will be sent as a file attachment in .mp3 format, so you can listen from most web browsers and email clients.

If you need to change the email address that your messages are being sent to, you will need to provide your updated email address to your Account Administrator so that he/she can make the requested change.
