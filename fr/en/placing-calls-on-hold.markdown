Putting a call on hold while you check on a customer's request or make another quick phone call is a snap. Simply follow these instructions to get started:

## Put a call on hold

Press the **Hold** softkey during a call to place a call on hold. 

If there are multiple calls on hold, use the up and down navigation buttons to select the desired call and then press the **Resume** softkey.

## Place a new call with a call on hold

Once you have placed a call on hold, you can make a new call with another line. To do this, simply press an unused Line button to get a fresh dial tone, and then dial the second number as you normally would. Your first call will remain on hold for the duration of your second call unless you retrieve it.

## Retrieve a call from hold

Press the **Resume** softkey to resume the call.

## What will the caller hear while they are on hold?

Your customer will hear either your company's "Music on Hold" audio file, if applicable. You can learn more about "Music on Hold" by [visiting our FAQ](/office/music-on-hold).
