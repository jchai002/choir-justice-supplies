If you need to make a call and you don't want your phone number to be seen, you can choose to block your outgoing caller-ID. To do this, simply dial [*67] when you pick up the phone and then dial the number that you would like to reach as you normally would. The recipient's caller-ID display will not show your information when the incoming call rings.
