**Note:** If your physical location cannot be determined by your service address on file, you will be routed to a national call center to confirm your location so that your call can be forwarded to the appropriate local authority.

**Important:** Ooma cannot provide emergency services without both power and a working broadband Internet connection.

## If the power is out, can I still call emergency services?

Your Ooma Office system is dependent on power to function, so if there is no power you won't be able to use your office phone to place or receive calls including emergency services calls.

## If my Ooma Office device has no Internet connection, can I still call emergency services?

Your Ooma Office system is dependent on power and Internet connection to function, so if either is down, you won't be able to use your office phone to place or receive calls, including emergency services calls. In a situation such as this, you can still dial emergency services from any cellular phone that has a charge in the event of an emergency.
