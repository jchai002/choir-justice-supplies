Ooma Office for WeWork includes a full suite of features to grow with your small business while supporting its communication needs. These features include: 

## Account features

### Unlimited domestic calling

Calls to cell phones and landlines in France are free. Ooma Office also includes calls to landlines in 12 other European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.

### IP phone included

The monthly fee for each Ooma Office user includes an IP phone rental. IP phones are shipped directly to the WeWork facility of your choice, and are preconfigured with all of the user's information. All you need to do is plug the phone in at a WeWork facility.

### Support for multiple users

Ooma Office scales so that every employee can have his or her own extension, direct phone number, fax line, and voicemail. [Learn more](/fr/en/setting-up-extensions).

### Additional phone numbers

Ooma Office can accommodate your company's needs with additional phone numbers beyond what is included in your Ooma Office subscription. [Learn more](/fr/en/adding-additional-phone-numbers).

### Phone number mapping

One or more phone numbers may be assigned to the virtual receptionist, a user, a ring group, or the conference service. [Learn more](/fr/en/mapping-phone-numbers).
