## Switching Workspaces

One of the benefits of an IP phone is that it can make changing workspaces quick and easy. When a user relocates to a new workspace, they can simply unplug their IP phone and take it with them. When the phone is plugged in again inside the same office building, it will retain the user's extension information.
