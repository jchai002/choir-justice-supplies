## Why am I unable to make or receive phone calls with the Ooma Office app on iOS while I am using the T-Mobile network?

The most recent version of the Ooma Office app for iOS (version 2.1) is designed to support the IPV4 standard instead of the IPV6 standard that T-Mobile has begun to use. Currently, the app is incompatible with the T-Mobile network, although it is still fully functional on Wi-Fi. We are aware of this critical issue, and we are working to resolve the problem with the next version of the app.
