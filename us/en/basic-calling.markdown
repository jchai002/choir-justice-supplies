The Ooma Office for WeWork system has several different calling options to choose from. The article below outlines each of the different types of calls you can make and receive as part of your basic Ooma Office subscription, and explains how to perform each option.

## Receiving incoming calls

An extension will ring when the number that has been assigned to it has been dialed directly, or when the Virtual Receptionist redirects an incoming call to that extension. You can answer a call by picking up the IP  phone when it rings.

## Dialing internal numbers

You can call another extension by dialing the extension number. Calling a virtual extension places a call to the external forwarding number.

## Dialing out

You can make an external call by picking up your phone and dialing the outbound number as you normally would. You do not need to dial "9" or any other special code to make an external phone call.

Calls to the United States and Canada are included as part of your monthly calling package.

In addition to the calling options listed above, your Account Administrator can activate a Prepaid Account that will allow all end user employees to draw upon that account to make calls to international numbers and to directory services.

## Calling international numbers

If there are sufficient funds in your Prepaid Account, you can take advantage of the low international calling rates that Ooma offers by dialing 011, followed by the country code and phone number.

You will hear the Prepaid Account balance before your call is connected, letting you know that sufficient funds are available to complete your call.

## 411 calling

You can dial 411 and other similar services directly provided that there are sufficient funds available in your Prepaid Account. You will hear the Prepaid Account balance before your call is connected, letting you know that sufficient funds are available.
