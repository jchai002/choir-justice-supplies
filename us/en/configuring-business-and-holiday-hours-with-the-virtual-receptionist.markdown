In addition to directing incoming calls and providing an avenue for sharing useful information with your customers and business associates, the Virtual Receptionist supports an "After Hours Menu" that will play whenever your business is closed. You can choose your operating hours and identify business holidays, giving you fine-tuned control that you can use to make your Virtual Receptionist as efficient as possible.

## How do I set my business hours?

You can set your business operating hours by following these instructions:

1. Log into your Ooma Office Manager at [office.ooma.com](office.ooma.com) and navigate to "[Receptionist]({{ site.office_link.us }}/#virtual_receptionist)" under the "Setup" tab.
2. Click on "Business Hours Schedule."
3. Select a day of the week, or a range of days from the drop-down menu and then set each end of the slider to your business's hours, as shown below. If your business is open at different times on different days of the week, you can add new lines by clicking the "+Add new time interval" button: \\
   ![business hours]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ooma_office_manager/business_hours.png)

4. Use the slider to set your business hours for the days of the week that you selected from the drop-down menu.
