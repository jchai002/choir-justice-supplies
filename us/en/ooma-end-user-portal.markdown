## Preferences

### Voicemail Preferences

To access your voicemail preferences, navigate to the Voicemail option beneath the Preferences tab.

From the Voicemail Preferences interface, you can do the following:

* Uncheck the Voicemail enabled checkbox if you wish to disable voicemail on your extension.
* Adjust how long you want your extension to ring before sending an incoming call to voicemail.
* Change your voicemail PIN by entering a 4 to 8-digit number. This PIN is used when you access your voicemail remotely.
* Check the "Include audio file in in voicemail notification" checkbox to attach an MP3 audio file of each new voicemail message to voicemail notification emails.

Click the Save button to save your settings.

### Call Forwarding Preferences

To configure your call forwarding preferences, navigate to the Call Forwarding option beneath the Preferences tab.

<p align="center"><img alt="call forwarding" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/end_user_portal/call_forwarding_preferences.png" /></p>

From the Call Forwarding Preferences interface you can do the following:

* Check the Enable Call Forwarding checkbox if you wish to enable call forwarding for your extension.
* Enter the phone number that calls will be forwarded to in the Forwarding number field. You must supply a phone number to enable call forwarding.
* Check the Simultaneously ring local extension checkbox if you want your office phone extension and your forwarding number to ring at the same time when calls are forwarded. You can answer from either location when this option is enabled.
* Check the Require key press on answer checkbox if you want to be prompted to press 1 to answer a forwarded call. Turning this option on prevents your calls from being sent to your mobile phone's voicemail if you don't answer, if your cell is turned off, or if you do not have a signal.

Click the Save button to save your settings.

### Caller-ID Preferences

If your extension can be reached by dialing multiple phone numbers, then you can manage your caller ID preferences by navigating to the Caller-ID option beneath the Preferences tab.

<p align="center"><img alt="caller ID preferences" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/end_user_portal/caller_id_preference.png" /></p>

From this interface, you can select which phone number you want to use as your outgoing caller-id from the "Outgoing Caller ID" drop down. This is the phone number that other people will see when you call them.

When you are done, click the Save button to save your settings.
