## Blind transfer (one-step)

A blind transfer sends the caller to the new extension without any interaction between the person transferring the call and the extension receiving the transfer.

To perform a blind transfer, you should press the **TRAN** button or **Tran** softkey during a call to place the call on hold.

Enter the extension or number that you wish to transfer to, and then hit the **TRAN** button or softkey again.

## Attended transfer (two-step)

If your transfer needs to be announced or explained, or if you want to make sure that the person you are transferring to is able to answer before sending the call over, you can perform an attended transfer.

To perform an attended transfer, you should Press the **TRAN** button or **Tran** softkey during a call to place the call on hold.

Enter the extension or number that you wish to transfer to, and then hit the #send button and wait until the second party answers. If they wish to take the call, press the **Tran** softkey again. If they do not wish to take the call or if there is no answer, press the **Resume** softkey to connect with the caller again.
