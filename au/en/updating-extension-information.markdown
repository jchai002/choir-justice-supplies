Since each extension has its own personal information, it is important to make sure that each extension is up to date with the information of the employee who is using it.

## How can I update the information for an extension?

You can update the information for an extension by following these steps:

1. Log into your Ooma Office Manager at [{{ site.office_link.au }}]({{ site.office_link.au }}) and navigate to "[Extensions]({{ site.office_link.au }}/#extensions)" under the "Setup" tab.
2. Click the "Setup" button next to the extension whose number you wish to change: \\
   ![manage extensions]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ooma_office_wework/edit_extension_wework.png)

3. In the "Basic" tab you can update the user's information.
4. When you are done, save your changes to exit the screen.

## What personal information can an extension have?

An extension can have a first name, last name, email address, and password.

**Note:** Each extension must have a unique name.
