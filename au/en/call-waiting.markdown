A must-have for any successful business, call waiting is your way of knowing that there's another call that needs your attention while you are on the phone. Since call waiting is part of the standard Ooma Office package, you can rest assured that you won't miss an incoming call.

## How does call waiting work?

When you're on the phone and another call comes in, an electronic beep will sound to let you know that someone else wants to talk.

## Will I be able to see caller-ID for the incoming call?

Yes, you should be able to see the call waiting caller-ID for the second incoming call.

## Can I conference the second call together with the first call?

You can conference two calls together by following the instructions in our [IP phone user guide](office/yealink-user-guide#three-way-call-conferencing). You can learn more about conference calling with Ooma Office by [visiting our FAQ](/au/en/three-way-call-conferencing).

## How can I disable call waiting on my extension?

You can disable call waiting for a single phone call by dialling [*70] before you dial your number.
